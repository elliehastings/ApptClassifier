# Appointment Classifier

This is a proof-of-concept for using machine learning to classify scheduled appointments at a primary care practice based on the free text reason for appointment.

This project was developed as part of the 2017 [Iora Health](https://www.iorahealth.com/) Hackfest when I was still on the Product team, as an experiment to use automated appointment classification to improve scheduling workflows.

### Prerequisites

Requires Python 3.6 and the pytest, pandas, and scikit-learn libraries.
